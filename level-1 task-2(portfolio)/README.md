# Task 2 — Portfolio

## Objective
Create a small portfolio page that lists projects, shows contact/intro information, and demonstrates interactivity (basic JS enhancements).

## What I built
- `index.html`, `index.css` and `index.js` forming a lightweight portfolio site.
- Responsive layout for project cards and a compact navigation.
- Small JavaScript functionality for interaction (for example: filtering projects, toggling mobile menu, or simple animations).

## Steps performed
1. Created HTML structure for a profile/hero, projects grid, and footer.
2. Implemented responsive CSS (`index.css`) for layout, cards, and typography.
3. Implemented small JS (`index.js`) for interactive behaviours (menu toggle / project filters / smooth scrolling).
4. Tested layout on mobile and desktop breakpoints and adjusted spacing and font sizes.

## Tools & tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- VS Code + Live Server (for preview)
- Browser devtools for responsive testing

## How to preview
Open `level-1 task-2(portfolio)/index.html` in a browser. If you have Live Server, open the file with it for hot-reload.

## Outcome (brief)
An interactive portfolio page showcasing projects, responsive card layout, and small JS-driven enhancements for user experience.

# Task 1 — Landing Page

## Objective
Create a responsive landing page that demonstrates layout, hero section, and basic branding for the project.

## What I built
- A single-page landing layout (`index.html`) styled with CSS in `resources/css/style.css` and `resources/css/responsive.css` (or equivalent files under `vendors/css`).
- Included normalization and a responsive grid system from the `vendors` folder to help with consistent layout across browsers.

## Steps performed
1. Built the semantic HTML structure (header, hero, call-to-action, footer).
2. Imported `normalize.css` and responsive grid files from `vendors/css` for consistent cross-browser rendering and an easy grid.
3. Added responsive CSS rules to make the layout adapt to desktop/tablet/mobile.
4. Added images and assets under `resources/images` and referenced them in the markup.

## Tools & tech
- HTML5, CSS3
- Normalize.css and a responsive grid system (provided in `vendors/css`)
- Editor: VS Code
- Preview: Browser or Live Server extension in VS Code

## How to preview
1. Open `level 1 -task-1 (Landing Page)/index.html` in your browser.
2. (Optional) Start the Live Server extension in VS Code to see live updates.

## Outcome (brief)
A responsive landing page with a clean layout that adapts to different viewports and uses a small grid system for layout consistency.

# Task 3 — Temperature Converter

## Objective
Build a responsive temperature converter web page that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## What I built
- `index.html` — the UI with an input field, unit selectors, a Convert button, and an output field.
- `client.js` — JavaScript logic that reads the input and selected units, performs conversions, and writes the output.
- `index.css` — modernized styling (glass card, gradients, accessible focus states, and responsive rules).

## Steps performed
1. Implemented the HTML structure with IDs used by the JavaScript: `inputTemp`, `fromUnit`, `toUnit`, `outputTemp`.
2. Wrote `client.js` to handle conversions and input validation (handles empty or invalid input gracefully).
3. Rewrote `index.css` with a modern  stylesheet (variables, card layout, polished inputs/buttons, and responsive breakpoints).
4. Tested conversions and UI on desktop and mobile widths.

## Tools & tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- VS Code (editor)
- Browser for testing (or Live Server extension for live reload)

## How to preview
1. Open `level-1 task-3(temprature converter)/index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter a numeric temperature, choose the "from" and "to" units, then click Convert.

## Outcome (brief)
A clean, modern-looking temperature converter that accurately converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, with a responsive UI and accessible controls.
